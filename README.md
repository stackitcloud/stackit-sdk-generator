# Overview

This repository implements the automatic generation of client libraries to access STACKIT APIs. It is based on the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/). The process' input are the REST API specs in the [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) format (OAS), which are stored in [STACKIT API specifications](https://github.com/stackitcloud/stackit-api-specifications).

Currently only generation of Go libraries are supported. The output is stored in the [STACKIT GO SDK repo](https://github.com/stackitcloud/stackit-sdk-go).

## Getting started

If you want to modify script or templates and you can run code locally.

Requires `Go 1.21` or higher.

1. Set up the project and tools by running
   ```
   make project-tools
   ```
2. Download Open Api Specifications (OAS), that are the input for the SDK generation, by running
   ```
   make download-oas
   ```
   This step needs to be done only at the first start and when OAS updates are present.
3. Run the SDK generation for testing by
   ```
   make generate-sdk
   ```
   The output goes to the `./sdk` folder.
