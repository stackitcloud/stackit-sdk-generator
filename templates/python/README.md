# Python templates

This folder contains only our customized python templates. Beside these customized templates,
the original templates of openapi-generator for python are used. These can be found in the 
official GitHub repo of the [openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/tree/v7.14.0/modules/openapi-generator/src/main/resources/python).

If you need to change something in the Python Generator, try always first to add
[user-defined templates](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/customization#user-defined-templates),
instead of overwriting existing templates. These ensure an easier upgrade process, to newer
versions of the openapi-generator.

If it's required to customize the original templates, you can copy them into this directory.  
Try to minimize the customization as much as possible, to ensure, that we can easily upgrade
to newer versions in the future.
